# 1. Business Context and Project Scope

## 1.1 Industry Context
Energy companies operate in a highly regulated and data-intensive environment.  
They manage large volumes of time-series data generated by smart meters, operational systems, and external market sources.

Key challenges include:
- fragmented data sources
- limited real-time visibility on energy consumption
- difficulties in detecting abnormal behaviors
- increasing pressure to optimize operational costs and energy efficiency

---

## 1.2 Business Problem
The company lacks a unified data platform to:
- centralize energy consumption data
- provide reliable and up-to-date analytics
- support operational and strategic decision-making

Data is currently spread across multiple systems, making analyses slow, inconsistent, and difficult to scale.

---

## 1.3 Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to design and implement a centralized data platform that:
- consolidates energy-related data into a single source of truth
- enables scalable analytics on large time-series datasets
- supports anomaly detection on consumption patterns
- prepares the foundation for future machine learning use cases

---

## 1.4 Scope of the Project
The project covers the following scope:
- ingestion of simulated energy consumption data
- integration of customer and contract reference data
- implementation of a Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- delivery of business-ready datasets for analytics and BI

Out of scope:
- real-time operational control systems
- direct interaction with production energy infrastructure
- deployment of models into live production environments

---

## 1.5 Key Assumptions
The project is based on the following assumptions:
- energy consumption data is ingested in batch mode
- data volumes are large enough to justify a distributed processing engine
- the platform is hosted on a cloud environment
- security and governance requirements follow industry standards (GDPR-like)

---

## 1.6 Constraints and Risks
Main constraints and risks include:
- data quality issues in raw sources
- cost control related to cloud and Databricks usage
- complexity of time-series data modeling
- governance and access management challenges

These risks are addressed through:
- layered data architecture
- data quality checks
- cost monitoring and optimization strategies
- role-based access control

---

## 1.7 Success Criteria
The project will be considered successful if:
- data pipelines are reliable and reproducible
- analytics queries perform efficiently on large datasets
- business KPIs can be easily consumed by BI tools
- the platform is extensible for future use cases
